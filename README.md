# GoOutside iOS App
This iOS app not only gives you the forecast but tries to predict how well you will like the upcoming weather based on your settings.
## The Idea
This weather app goes one step beyond your typical weather app. It's based on the idea that different people enjoy different types of weather. Some people like hot and sunny days, others like cool and partly clouds days, and some people may prefer rainy days. This app allows the user to configure their "ideal weather conditions," such as weather and precipitation. It then takes the weekly forcast and predicts on a scale from 0% to 100% whether or not you are going to like the weather on that particular day. This is what the app looks like:

## Technologies Used
* Wunderground Weather API - Used to get weather forcast for the next 7 days. Included information such as temperature, precipitation chance, and cloud cover.
* Swift - The language used to write the iOS app. For this project, I tried to explore ways in which I could make the app costmetically appealing; for instance, I made a customoized list view which separated the items in the list, had a slightly transparent background, and had rounded off corners. I also used .png resources for the weather icons so that there was an image associated with the different types of forcasts (ex. cloudy, sunny, stormy, snow).
